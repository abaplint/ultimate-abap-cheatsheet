In todays world, with AI helping in ABAP development, its important for #ABAP developers to remember the statement syntax, so I thought I'd help by creating a simple cheatsheet for ABAP statement syntax.

Its somewhat correct and contains the syntax for statements only. No information what the statements do or how to format the nested expressions.

It is provided as PDF in A0 format, so it continently can be printed and displayed in the office for easy counsel.
